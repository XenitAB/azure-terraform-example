# AKS Readme

This is for AKS without defining an already existing vnet/subnet.

## First run

It will fail the first time it runs. Let it fail and then go through the below steps and then run it again.

## Manual configuration

### Azure AD Applications

#### Server

##### Server admin consent

Go to your Azure AD Directory (after terraform has been applied) and then App Registrations > All Applications > `app-${var.environmentShort}-${var.commonName}-server` > API Permissions and click `Grant admin consent`. Verify that the status is changed on the permissions.

#### Client

##### Client admin consent

Go to your Azure AD Directory (after terraform has been applied) and then App Registrations > All Applications > `app-${var.environmentShort}-${var.commonName}-client` > API Permissions and click `Grant admin consent`. Verify that the status is changed on the permissions.

## Using with Azure DevOps

Since it's not possible to use Service Principals together with AKS when Azure AD authentication is enabled, we've created service accounts in the namespace `serivce-accounts` (or something else if you've changed the terraform variable `k8sSaNamespace`).

When adding a service connection in Azure DevOps for Kubernetes, choose service account. Export it using (when logged on as admin):

```bash
kubectl -n service-accounts get secret <service account secret> -o yaml
```
